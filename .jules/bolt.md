## 2026-05-04 - Parallel JSON Loading Optimization
**Learning:** In a Java app making many small file reads and parsing JSON (e.g., loading thousands of deck files), parallelizing the file reading and parsing using `Files.list(dir).parallel()` over `Files.newDirectoryStream` yields a significant performance improvement (~58% faster) since it utilizes multi-core IO and parsing instead of sequential processing.
**Action:** Always consider parallel streams for bulk file loading/deserialization tasks when dealing with a large volume of separate small files.
