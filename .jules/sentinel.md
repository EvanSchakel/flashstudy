## 2024-05-04 - Missing Global Error Handling in CLI Apps
**Vulnerability:** The application lacks a global exception handler and does not check for end-of-file (EOF) on standard input, which leads to raw stack traces being printed to the console when an unexpected error occurs or input abruptly ends.
**Learning:** Even in command-line applications, uncaught exceptions can leak internal application state, class names, and execution paths through stack traces. This is considered information leakage and can aid an attacker in understanding the application's structure.
**Prevention:** Always implement a global `try-catch` block (or `Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler`) at the entry point of the application to catch unhandled errors, log them securely if needed, and exit gracefully with a generic error message. Additionally, always validate standard input availability (e.g., `Scanner.hasNextLine()`) to prevent abrupt crashes on EOF.
## 2026-05-06 - [Enforce secure file permissions]
**Vulnerability:** Data storage directory for flashcards lacked explicit permission constraints, risking unauthorized read/write access to user data.
**Learning:** Default directory creation (Files.createDirectories) uses umask, which can be overly permissive.
**Prevention:** Always explicitly set restrictive permissions (e.g. owner-only readable/writable/executable) on directories containing sensitive user data via `File#setReadable(false, false)` followed by `File#setReadable(true, true)` (and similarly for writable and executable).
## 2026-05-10 - [Path Traversal in DeckStore]
**Vulnerability:** The DeckStore's sanitization pattern allowed periods (`.`), which could permit path traversal attacks via `..` sequences in file names, allowing an attacker to read/write outside the designated directory.
**Learning:** File names derived from user input must be strictly sanitized, with explicit exclusion of potentially dangerous characters like `.` that can be used to construct relative path segments.
**Prevention:** Always use a strict whitelist for file name sanitization that explicitly excludes periods (`.`) unless necessary and safely handled.
