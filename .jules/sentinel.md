## 2024-05-04 - Missing Global Error Handling in CLI Apps
**Vulnerability:** The application lacks a global exception handler and does not check for end-of-file (EOF) on standard input, which leads to raw stack traces being printed to the console when an unexpected error occurs or input abruptly ends.
**Learning:** Even in command-line applications, uncaught exceptions can leak internal application state, class names, and execution paths through stack traces. This is considered information leakage and can aid an attacker in understanding the application's structure.
**Prevention:** Always implement a global `try-catch` block (or `Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler`) at the entry point of the application to catch unhandled errors, log them securely if needed, and exit gracefully with a generic error message. Additionally, always validate standard input availability (e.g., `Scanner.hasNextLine()`) to prevent abrupt crashes on EOF.
## 2026-05-06 - [Enforce secure file permissions]
**Vulnerability:** Data storage directory for flashcards lacked explicit permission constraints, risking unauthorized read/write access to user data.
**Learning:** Default directory creation (Files.createDirectories) uses umask, which can be overly permissive.
**Prevention:** Always explicitly set restrictive permissions (e.g. owner-only readable/writable/executable) on directories containing sensitive user data via `File#setReadable(false, false)` followed by `File#setReadable(true, true)` (and similarly for writable and executable).
## 2024-05-24 - [Fix Local DoS when parsing multiple user files]
**Vulnerability:** Parsing multiple JSON files via a stream without catching `RuntimeException`s (like `JsonSyntaxException` from Gson) allows a single malformed file to terminate the entire batch load, causing a local Denial of Service (DoS).
**Learning:** When reading from user-controlled directories, do not assume file content validity. An unhandled syntax exception breaks the application flow for all other valid files.
**Prevention:** When parsing multiple files in a loop or stream, explicitly catch parsing-specific `RuntimeException`s (or a general `Exception`) around the read operation to ensure fault tolerance.
